Week 11 Assignment
Repo owner: John Riviello
Collaborator: Enrique Vargas

"Peace is not absence of conflict, it is the ability to handle conflict by peaceful means.... and for that there is GitHub!"

Steps To Do:
- [x] Ask your collaborator to make a change to the repository
- [x] In order to keep abreast of the changes made by your collaborator, you will need to pull changes from the repository and sync things up by using the pull command: `git pull origin master --rebase`
- [x] You and your collaborator change the same line of code and try to push the change to the repository. One of you will be fine and one will receive a conflict message.
- [x] Work together to resolve the conflict.
- [ ] Post screenshots to the forum!
